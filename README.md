Project No.1: Functional-Todo-List-App ðŸ—“
A Simple and Functional Todo list app - This is my first Frontend Web project which I applied my basic knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JS. 

In this Todo list app, I added the most basic functional and interactive features:

â€¢ There are (2) main tasklist in this Todo list app:

    a.) In Progress Tasklist - This is where all the new, unchecked, and old added task will appear in this Tasklist.
  
    b.) Completed Tasklist - This is where all marked and checked task will be moved in this Tasklist. Enhancing the filter between undone and done tasks.

â€¢ Theme Switcher - Switch between Light mode and Dark mode freely.

â€¢ Error Tasklist Message - This message will appear if the user clicks the Add Task button without inputting their task in the input bar.


I hope you can enjoy and support my projects. THANK YOUðŸ˜Š.

PROJECT FINISHED DATE: SEPTEMBER 21, 2022.
